##Alfred App
Alfred app is without a doubt my most used and favorite application on Mac. If you've spotlight search
on Mac, then Alfred should feel very familiar to you. Alfred is an application and task launcher on
steroids!



Opening a file or folder on my computer in Sublime Text:

Finding documentation on a web development topic:

Opening selected folder in Finder inside Terminal, then from terminal to Finder:

Kill processes (great for unresponsive apps)

Show Trash, Restart, Shutdown, Lock, and Sleep your Computer (Spotlight currently doesn't do this)

Send messages on Slack and iMessages in seconds:

Searches for Youtube, Amazon, Linkedin, Twitter, Google..and a lot more:

According my Alfred App since May 20, 2015 I've launched the Application 4020 times. If on average each task I didn't do on Alfred takes 5 seconds,
then I have saved over 350 minutes(being very conservative) worth of keystrokes since in the past 5 months. 

Stuff I didn't cover:

- Alfred can accept url links in it's search bar & take you to a webpage directly
- create your own workflows in Python, JavaScript, Ruby and a slew of other languages
- sharing your own workflows or downloading other user-creates ones on Packal.org


Next computer productivity goals:

- learn to web browse using Vimium
- learn how to touch type
