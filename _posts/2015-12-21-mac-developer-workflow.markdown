##Alfred App
[Alfred app](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for Mac is without a doubt my most used and favorite application on Mac. If you've used spotlight search on Mac then Alfred should feel very familiar to you. In essence, Alfred is a free application task launcher on
steroids! Below are some of the tasks I frequently do that have been automated with Alfred.



Opening a file or folder on my computer in my text editor, Sublime Text:

Finding documentation on a web development topic:
![events-0](/assets/images/posts/004m.gif)

Find a folder via search & open it in the terminal
![events-0](/assets/images/posts/0045m.gif)

Opening selected folder in Finder inside Terminal, then from terminal to Finder:
![events-0](/assets/images/posts/005m.gif)


Kill processes (great for unresponsive apps)

Show Trash, Restart, Shutdown, Lock, and Sleep your Computer (Spotlight currently doesn't do this)

Send messages on Slack and iMessages in seconds:

Searches for Youtube, Amazon, Linkedin, Twitter, Google..and a lot more:

According my Alfred App, since May 20, 2015 I've launched the Application 4020 times. If on average each task I didn't do on Alfred takes 5 seconds then I have saved over 350 minutes (being very conservative) worth of keystrokes since in the past 5 months.

Stuff I didn't cover:

- Alfred can accept url links in it's search bar, which allows you to launch web pages
- You can create your own workflows in Python, JavaScript, Ruby and a slew of other languages
- Sharing your own workflows or downloading other user-creates ones on Packal.org


Next computer productivity goals:

- learn to web browse using Vimium and learn VIM key bindings
- extend my bash and zsh profile
