Below are some of the lessons I've learned over the past few months as a software engineer.

### Takeaways
- Software is created by humans, so when software breaks be empathetic and calm.

- Many times you need to implement naive solution to grasp a problem, then optimize for performance.
- Google, StackOverflow, and blogs are your best friends!
- Just because I'm not into x category of programming doesn't mean I'm a bad programmer. Some people excel in the front end, others in the backend, others enjoy working on databases and the list goes on.
- Separating tasks into smaller chunks helps my mind process things better.
- Take things day by day or else you just might overwhelm yourself.
- Don't feel guilty about asking for help or modifying existing code to meet your own needs. In software development, building on top of foundation others have built will help you a lot. NOTE: I'm not saying don't ever reinvent the wheel.
- Recognizing patterns in others code will take you a long way.
