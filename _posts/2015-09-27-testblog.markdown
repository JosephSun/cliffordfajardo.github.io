You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight javascript %}
var a = 1;
var let = 2;
array.map(x => x + 1);

let person = {name: 'John Smith'};
let tpl = `My name is ${person.name}.`;
{% endhighlight %}
